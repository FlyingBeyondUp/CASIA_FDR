The arrangements of codes are
 • Two Group Model: includes the function that obtain marginal, null, al
ternative distributions and lfdr by the two-group model.
 • Distributions: defines the different prior alternative distributions used in
 the numerical simulations.
 • NewDeal: includes a data generation function and the class NewDeal,
 which accept two lists (numpy.array) ˆ β and ˆ s as inputs and provides
 methods to estimate π and other related quantities. Two different prior
 alternative distributions are realized, which are normal and uniform dis
tributions, respectively.
 • PlotFigures: includes all the codes to plot the figures shown in this report.
